# Researching styling technologies

This is a small project to test various styling technologies, how difficult they are to work with, their learning curve, etc. as well as some basic benchmarking against performance, bundle size, etc.

Each technology has a series of components, all within their respective technology folder, to recreate a specific layout showcasing how to use each library. There is also the required packages and their vite plugins where necessary to showcase how the technologies work with the bundler.

### Frontend tooling:

- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/guide/)

## Global Dependencies

To run the frontend, you will need Node (v18+) and NPM (preferably via Node Version Manager or "NVM") installed and updated. [See the Free Code Camp guide here for details](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/node-version-manager-nvm-install-guide/)

## Starting the frontend

Ensure you have the above global dependencies installed before continuing:

1. Open a Terminal and navigate to the `root` folder.

2. Install the required dependencies:

```
npm install
```

3. Once the dependencies are all installed, you can start the server:

```
npm run dev
```

4. The frontend will now be running on the following url: http://localhost:5173 - the terminal will output the current port number if this is already in use on your local machine.
